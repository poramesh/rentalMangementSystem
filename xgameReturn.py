''' A Python module containing functions that prompt the
store manager for the ID of the game(s) they wish to return. It should
provide either an appropriate error message or a confirmation message.'''

'''The store manager should be able to return games by providing the game's ID.
The database should be updated accordingly. If the ID is invalid, or the game is
already available, the program should return an error message. '''
